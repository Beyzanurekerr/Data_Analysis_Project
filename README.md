# Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success

This project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict student dropout rates and academic success. The dataset contains data from a higher education institution on various variables related to undergraduate students, including demographics, socio-economic factors, and academic performance, to investigate the impact of these factors on student dropout and academic success.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to analyze student data and predict dropout rates and academic success using machine learning models. By analyzing various factors, such as demographics and socio-economic status, the model tries to predict students' likelihood of dropout or success in higher education.

## Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing data is cleaned, and only relevant features are used to train the model.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Support Vector Machines (SVC) are used to train the model with the best parameters.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Feature Importance Graph**
   - **Purpose**: This graph shows how important each independent variable is in predicting the target variable. The ranking of features helps us understand which features the model relies on the most.

### 2. **Histogram**
   - **Purpose**: This histogram shows the distribution of numerical variables in the dataset. It allows us to observe which ranges have higher concentrations and understand the distribution of the dataset.

### 3. **Age at Enrollment and Unemployment Rate Relationship**
   - **Purpose**: This scatterplot shows the relationship between students' age at enrollment and unemployment rate. The "Gender" variable is also represented by different colors, allowing us to observe how this relationship varies across genders.
